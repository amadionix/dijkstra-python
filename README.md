# dijkstra-python
Dijsktra's algorithm in Python, using a Binary Heap to implement the Priority Queue and covering both the version that uses the decrease-key method and the one that doesn't use it.

Project Work for the course in Combinatorial Optimization, MSc Computer Science, University of Milan, AY 2019/2020.

In the test-graphs folder I added one graph you can test the algorithms with. 
If you want to generate your own graphs or download real routing graphs from US roard network, I suggest you to check this page out: http://users.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml
